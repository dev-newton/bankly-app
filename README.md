# Bankly — Frontend Take-Home

A small **React + TypeScript (Vite)** app that fetches **accounts** and **transactions** from mocked API routes (MSW), shows them with a clean UI (Radix Tabs), and demonstrates patterns for **data fetching (SWR)**, **loading/error states**, **locale formatting**, and **tests (Vitest + Testing Library + MSW)**.

---

## Taks Completed (5 out of 6) 

- Connecting to the API 🎉
- Creating a loading state 🎉
- Creating an error state 🎉
- User oriented formatting 🎉
- Fix the test ❌ (I fixed the failing first transaction test and some tests in the second test, but I still couldn't get it to work 😔)
- Match the designs 🎉

### Loading states for Accounts and Transactions
- The shell (page title + tabs) always renders.
- Initial load shows Loading… only in the panel area (no layout jump).

### Error States for Accounts and Transactions
- Error UI at the feature level with a clear message and a Retry button (calls mutate()).

# tests
npm run test

```

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**
- **SWR** — cache / dedupe / revalidate
- **MSW** — mock API in dev & tests
- **Vitest** + **@testing-library/react**
- **Radix UI Tabs**

---

### Accessibility

- Error banner uses role="alert".
- Retry is a button styled as text (keeps keyboard & SR support).

### Notes & Trade-offs

- Why SWR? Cleaner components + cache/dedupe/revalidate. “Vanilla” useEffect + AbortController also included in earlier iterations (easy swap), but SWR provides nicer UX with less boilerplate.
- Polling is off by default; enable refreshInterval for continuous freshness. Banking feeds typically refresh on focus or on demand.

### Possible Next Steps

- Persist “last updated” timestamps per resource.
- Virtualize long tables.
